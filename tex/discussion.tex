\subsection{Out of Scope}\label{out-of-scope}

\paragraph{Dynamic Analysis}\label{dynamic-analysis}

We did not work with dynamic analysis, because the performance on mobile
devices would decrease massively. We work exclusively with static
analysis

\paragraph{Obfuscation}\label{obfuscation}

If the malware is being obfuscated then the decompilation would face
problems, because countering obfuscation requires a whole new project
and was not further included in these methods

\paragraph{Entropy/Randomness}\label{entropyrandomness}

We tried to detect and measure randomness of strings inside the code,
but it turned out, that most urls would appear random and this would
sharply increase the false positive rate. This method would require a
list of known bad urls.

\paragraph{Semantic Analysis}\label{semantic-analysis}

This type of analysis is used to approximate concepts through structures
build from a large set of information. This is out of scope.

\subsection{Namesake}\label{namesake}

Our organization heavily revolves around the infamous
\href{https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/Medien-DB/sec/pubs/2014-ndss.pdf}{DREBIN}
paper, which shares the name with a beloved Leslie Nielsen character
from the filmseries ``The Naked Gun''. The movie lives off of slapstick
and puns, much like we do.
