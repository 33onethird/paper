\section{Conclusio}
We used two datasets - the Drebin dataset and the Ikarus dataset, both consisting of malware and beningware samples - to train various Machine Learning algorithms to detect malware. We showed that our implementation of a Random Forest surpassed the results of the original paper \cite{drebin}. We note that using the newer Ikarus dataset will yield better performance on state-of-the-art malware. We further note that any practical Machine Learning-based malware detection application will have to perpetually train on newer malware and benignware samples in order to keep up with changing technologies. We want to thank our instructors and collaborators for their efforts.
